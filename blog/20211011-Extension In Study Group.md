## extension

We know about the extensions on chrome,
it can be written in pure js

## show off the extension

Let's take a look on this extension demo

## what can this do?

1. web page event listening；
2. automation (bot, Tampermonkey, )
3. bookmark control；
4. download control；
5. tab/window control；
6. page script injection(Adblock);

simply, we can think that it's a script running on the background
plus, it's listening all the time.
