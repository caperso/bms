Extensions

We've seen, we've downloaded many extensions,We even rely on some of them often.

To the usersExtensions are apps, hosted by chrome.It's like a tool, a config to customize the chrome, make a chrome to their chrome

To the developersThe extension can be much more thatIt could be a playground, a test runner, or a bot, also can be a tracker, a watcher, or a leaker, an intentionally harmful program.

To make it short, I think the extension is fun to play, great to help.

What does the extension be capable of

Bookmark control

Download control

Tab control

Web page control (Grammarly)

Page script injection (Adblock);

Proxy

Event listening

Automation (bots, Tampermonkey)

Simply, we can regard it as scripts running in the background, providing the service, and be able to control your chrome.

Of course, they are powerful, but many abilities need permission,some even need confirmation by the user.

The extension store has rules to restrict the behavior of apps, in case of abuse.

How to build my own extension

For us, it's not a problem at all!

All the things are written in pure js

Here's a very professional doc

[Official doc]< >

Demo time

Let's take a look on this extension demo

Development

Requirements

js.

You can also import JQuery, lodash libs (react may need built file)

HTML, CSS

If the UI is needed

cookbook

[chrome-extension-api]< >

First step

manifest.json

There must be a manifest.json,

Like this

{
  "name": "DancingBot",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "A dancing bot",
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "./background.js"
  },
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "ui/index.html", // the UI
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "images/16.png" // "32 64 128"
    }
  },
  "icons": {
    "16": "images/16.png" // "32 64 128"
  },
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "contextMenus", "storage"],
  "manifest_version": 3 // !
}

manifest_version

manifest_version

Decides to connect which version of the extension API,

It's important because it's like a major version change,new features will be added and deprecated ones would be dropped

In 2020, it comes to version 3, bringing the security updates.

Like

replacing the background with service workers,

full promises support

< >

Google also gives a timeline of mv2

< >

By January 2023, v2 Chrome stops running Manifest V2 extensions

Of course, mv2 is still the most popular one.

Chrome 88 is the first one that supports mv3

permissions

activeTab

Requests that the extension be granted permissions according to the activeTab specification.

bookmarks

access to the chrome.bookmarks

clipboardRead/ clipboardWrite

it's Required if extension using document.execCommand('paste'|'copy'|'cut')

downloads

access to the chrome.downloads

geolocation

access to the chrome.geolocation

history

access to the chrome.history

Load your own extension

It's not complicated, and no need to compile it

Usually, the final built file of an extension is a .crx file,

But we don't have to publish it on the chrome extension store,We can just load the development root folder

Clone this repository

Open chrome://extensions/ URL in your Chrome browser

Turn on the Developer mode

Click the Load unpacked button

Select the folder with the extension

Built a form-filling-bot

Let's fill a form

< >

Given permissions

"permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "tabs",
    "scripting",
    "contextMenus",
],

Register the files

We put our script on background.service_worker

  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },

Yep, it's like a service,running all the time till you shutdown the chrome

Get a content script

in content_script, register a content.js file

  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"],
      "all_frames": true
    }
  ],

matches:

access the web context when the url match the rule

there are Match patterns in chrome.

all_frames:

js and CSS would inject into all frames, not only the most top one

Let's write a little js

function fillForm() {
  const data = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 32,
    address: "Any town",
    country: "Iceland",
    phone: "+1426855510",
  };

  const prefix = "data-form";

  document.querySelector(`[${prefix}-id="name"]`).value = data.name;
  document.querySelector(`[${prefix}-id="age"]`).value = data.age;
  document.querySelector(`[${prefix}-id="address"]`).value = data.address;
  document.querySelector(`[${prefix}-id="country"]`).value = data.country;
  document.querySelector(`[${prefix}-id="phone"]`).value = data.phone;
}

So a basic bot is done.

content.js

Chrome extension inject the script/css to the web context.

content scripts can access DOM

I think that's why the ADBlock be able to make the annoying advertisements disappear.

Each content script's runtime is isolated.

Content scripts live in an isolated world, allowing a content script to make changes to its JavaScript environment without conflicting with the page or other extensions' content scripts.

Tips on the content script

ES6 is supported, it's powered by chrome won't let you down

content_scripts cannot static import,

but it can import the scripts by

const url = chrome.runtime.getURL("src/js/main.js");
const mainScript = await import(url);

In content_script, this equals window, so that it has BOM object, no process object, it's not a node process / service

In extension scripts chrome.extension pointing to extension object itself

Give a UI

Filling the form automatically is good,but sometimes we need some interaction and options to choose

So here comes the UI part.

"action": {
  "default_popup": "src/ui/index.html",
  "default_icon": "src/assets/icon.png"
},

in the HTML, import the script

<script src="./index.js"></script>

Debugging

You can access your scripts by cmd + p to search the js filename on devtools

So you can directly put the breakpoint on lines you want, it would paused just like we debug the web.

if you change the manifest.json reload on extension page

Down to the API

On devtools, there is an object window.chrome, but is not the same with chrome object

Some most common API:

chrome.scripting - executing another script.

Permission required: scripting

chrome.runtime

the runtime object

chrome.runtime.onInstalled

Extension loaded hook

You can start listening here chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener()

chrome.bookmarks

bookmarks.create

bookmarks.getTree

bookmarks.remove

bookmarks.update

chrome.storage

chrome.webRequest

Service Worker

A quick introduction

popup welcome website

set rules: when to show to action page, when to run something

connect the server

push the notification

communicate the web via postMessage

onUninstall: popup feedback website

better offline experience

Example: DNS override (mv2)

// init
const settings = { domain: "", ip: "", enabled: false };
const requestFilter = { urls: ["<all_urls>"] };

const onBeforeSendHeadersHandler = (details) => {
  if (settings.enabled && details.url.indexOf(settings.ip) > -1) {
    details.requestHeaders.push({ name: "Host", value: settings.domain });
    return { requestHeaders: details.requestHeaders };
  }
};

// match and redirect
const onBeforeRequestHandler = function (details) {
  if (settings.enabled && details.url.indexOf(settings.domain) > -1) {
    return { redirectUrl: details.url.replace(settings.domain, settings.ip) };
  }
};

// fetching the data from extension storage
chrome.storage.sync.get(settings, function (result) {
  if (result.domain) settings.domain = result.domain;
  if (result.ip) settings.ip = result.ip;
  if (result.enabled) settings.enabled = result.enabled;
  chrome.browserAction.setIcon({
    path: (settings.enabled ? "enabled" : "disabled") + ".png",
  });
});

// proxy the requests
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  onBeforeRequestHandler,
  requestFilter,
  ["blocking"]
);
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders.addListener(
  onBeforeSendHeadersHandler,
  requestFilter,
  ["blocking", "requestHeaders"]
);
